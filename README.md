# GVAJNEZ

Gvajnez is a source collaboration tool optimised for sitting next to your friends. It's also an acronym in the Dutch language, translating to "Git For If You're Sitting Next To Each Other", which is entirely inappropriate since it doesn't provide git-like source control functionality. (Yet?)
